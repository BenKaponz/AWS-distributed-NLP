This Adonis , by name Henri de Marsay , was born in France , when Lord Dudley had just married the young lady , already Henri 's mother , to an old gentleman called M. de Marsay .

Then he handed over the child to an aged sister , a Demoiselle de Marsay , who took much care of him , and provided him , out of the meagre sum allowed by her brother , with a tutor , an abbe without a farthing , who took the measure of the youth 's future , and determined to pay himself out of the hundred thousand livres for the care given to his pupil , for whom he conceived an affection .

Then the great man , by name the Abbe de Maronis , completed the education of his pupil by making him study civilization under all its aspects : he nourished him on his experience , led him little into churches , which at that time were closed ; introduced him sometimes behind the scenes of theatres , more often into the houses of courtesans ; he exhibited human emotions to him one by one ; taught him politics in the drawing-rooms , where they simmered at the time , explained to him the machinery of government , and endeavored out of attraction towards a fine nature , deserted , yet rich in promise , virilely to replace a mother : is not the Church the mother of orphans ?
