I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name .
[I/PRP, have/VBP, seldom/RB, heard/VBN, him/PRP, mention/VB, her/PRP, under/IN, any/DT, other/JJ, name/NN, ./.]

It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler .

He was , I take it , the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen , but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position .
[He/PRP, was/VBD, ,/,, I/PRP, take/VBP, it/PRP, ,/,, the/DT, most/RBS, perfect/JJ, reasoning/NN, and/CC, observing/JJ, machine/NN, that/IN, the/DT, world/NN, has/VBZ, seen/VBN, ,/,, but/CC, as/IN, a/DT, lover/NN, he/PRP, would/MD, have/VB, placed/VBN, himself/PRP, in/IN, a/DT, false/JJ, position/NN, ./.]

But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results .
[But/CC, for/IN, the/DT, trained/VBN, reasoner/NN, to/TO, admit/VB, such/JJ, intrusions/NNS, into/IN, his/PRP$, own/JJ, delicate/NN, and/CC, finely/RB, adjusted/VBN, temperament/NN, was/VBD, to/TO, introduce/VB, a/DT, distracting/JJ, factor/NN, which/WDT, might/MD, throw/VB, a/DT, doubt/NN, upon/IN, all/DT, his/PRP$, mental/JJ, results/NNS, ./.]

Grit in a sensitive instrument , or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses , would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his .

And yet there was but one woman to him , and that woman was the late Irene Adler , of dubious and questionable memory .
[And/CC, yet/RB, there/EX, was/VBD, but/CC, one/CD, woman/NN, to/TO, him/PRP, ,/,, and/CC, that/IN, woman/NN, was/VBD, the/DT, late/JJ, Irene/NNP, Adler/NNP, ,/,, of/IN, dubious/JJ, and/CC, questionable/JJ, memory/NN, ./.]

I had seen little of Holmes lately .

My marriage had drifted us away from each other .
[My/PRP$, marriage/NN, had/VBD, drifted/VBD, us/PRP, away/RP, from/IN, each/DT, other/JJ, ./.]

My own complete happiness , and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment , were sufficient to absorb all my attention , while Holmes , who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul , remained in our lodgings in Baker Street , buried among his old books , and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition , the drowsiness of the drug , and the fierce energy of his own keen nature .

He was still , as ever , deeply attracted by the study of crime , and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues , and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police .
[He/PRP, was/VBD, still/RB, ,/,, as/IN, ever/RB, ,/,, deeply/RB, attracted/VBD, by/IN, the/DT, study/NN, of/IN, crime/NN, ,/,, and/CC, occupied/VBD, his/PRP$, immense/JJ, faculties/NNS, and/CC, extraordinary/JJ, powers/NNS, of/IN, observation/NN, in/IN, following/VBG, out/RP, those/DT, clues/NNS, ,/,, and/CC, clearing/VBG, up/RP, those/DT, mysteries/NNS, which/WDT, had/VBD, been/VBN, abandoned/VBN, as/RB, hopeless/JJ, by/IN, the/DT, official/JJ, police/NN, ./.]

From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings : of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder , of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee , and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland .
[From/IN, time/NN, to/TO, time/NN, I/PRP, heard/VBD, some/DT, vague/JJ, account/NN, of/IN, his/PRP$, doings/NNS, :/:, of/IN, his/PRP$, summons/NNS, to/TO, Odessa/NNP, in/IN, the/DT, case/NN, of/IN, the/DT, Trepoff/NNP, murder/NN, ,/,, of/IN, his/PRP$, clearing/NN, up/RB, of/IN, the/DT, singular/NN, tragedy/NN, of/IN, the/DT, Atkinson/NNP, brothers/NNS, at/IN, Trincomalee/NNP, ,/,, and/CC, finally/RB, of/IN, the/DT, mission/NN, which/WDT, he/PRP, had/VBD, accomplished/VBN, so/RB, delicately/JJ, and/CC, successfully/RB, for/IN, the/DT, reigning/VBG, family/NN, of/IN, Holland/NNP, ./.]

Beyond these signs of his activity , however , which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press , I knew little of my former friend and companion .

One night -- it was on the twentieth of March , 1888 -- I was returning from a journey to a patient -LRB- for I had now returned to civil practice -RRB- , when my way led me through Baker Street .

As I passed the well-remembered door , which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing , and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet , I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again , and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers .
[As/IN, I/PRP, passed/VBD, the/DT, well-remembered/JJ, door/NN, ,/,, which/WDT, must/MD, always/RB, be/VB, associated/VBN, in/IN, my/PRP$, mind/NN, with/IN, my/PRP$, wooing/NN, ,/,, and/CC, with/IN, the/DT, dark/JJ, incidents/NNS, of/IN, the/DT, Study/NN, in/IN, Scarlet/NNP, ,/,, I/PRP, was/VBD, seized/VBN, with/IN, a/DT, keen/JJ, desire/NN, to/TO, see/VB, Holmes/NNP, again/RB, ,/,, and/CC, to/TO, know/VB, how/WRB, he/PRP, was/VBD, employing/VBG, his/PRP$, extraordinary/JJ, powers/NNS, ./.]

From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird , and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine , which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty .

Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern .

I heard a gentle sound of movement , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger .

For half an hour I sat with straining ears .

At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low , clear whistle , but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely .

He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened .

The presence of the gipsies , and the use of the word ` band , ' which was used by the poor girl , no doubt , to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match , were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent .

The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training .

THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER 'S THUMB Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , for solution during the years of our intimacy , there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice -- that of Mr. Hatherley 's thumb , and that of Colonel Warburton 's madness .

The story has , I believe , been told more than once in the newspapers , but , like all such narratives , its effect is much less striking when set forth _ en bloc _ in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes , and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth .
