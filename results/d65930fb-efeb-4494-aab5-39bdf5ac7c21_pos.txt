SCENES FROM A COURTESAN 'S LIFE ESTHER HAPPY ; OR , HOW A COURTESAN CAN LOVE In 1824 , at the last opera ball of the season , several masks were struck by the beauty of a youth who was wandering about the passages and greenroom with the air of a man in search of a woman kept at home by unexpected circumstances .

The young dandy was so much absorbed in his anxious quest that he did not observe his own success ; he did not hear , he did not see the ironical exclamations of admiration , the genuine appreciation , the biting gibes , the soft invitations of some of the masks .

Though he was so handsome as to rank among those exceptional persons who come to an opera ball in search of an adventure , and who expect it as confidently as men looked for a lucky coup at roulette in Frascati 's day , he seemed quite philosophically sure of his evening ; he must be the hero of one of those mysteries with three actors which constitute an opera ball , and are known only to those who play a part in them ; for , to young wives who come merely to say , `` I have seen it , '' to country people , to inexperienced youths , and to foreigners , the opera house must on those nights be the palace of fatigue and dulness .

To these , that black swarm , slow and serried -- coming , going , winding , turning , returning , mounting , descending , comparable only to ants on a pile of wood -- is no more intelligible than the Bourse to a Breton peasant who has never heard of the Grand livre .

In this the spirit of the nation betrays itself .

Men who want to hide their good fortune can enjoy the opera ball without going there ; and masks who are absolutely compelled to go in come out again at once .

So the men who wear masks are either jealous husbands who come to watch their wives , or husbands on the loose who do not wish to be watched by them -- two situations equally ridiculous .

Several masks had laughed as they pointed this preposterous figure out to each other ; some had spoken to him , a few young men had made game of him , but his stolid manner showed entire contempt for these aimless shafts ; he went on whither the young man led him , as a hunted wild boar goes on and pays no heed to the bullets whistling about his ears , or the dogs barking at his heels .

At midnight nearly all the personages of this drama were assembled in the dining-room that had formerly been Esther 's -- a drama of which the interest lay hidden under the very bed of these tumultuous lives , and was known only to Esther , to Lucien , to Peyrade , to Contenson , the mulatto , and to Paccard , who attended his mistress .

Asie , without its being known to Contenson and Peyrade , had been asked by Madame du Val-Noble to come and help her cook .

Contenson read by the light of the wax-candles this `` Mene , Tekel , Upharsin , '' and slipped the scrap into his pocket ; but he knew how difficult it is to verify a handwriting in pencil , and , above all , a sentence written in Roman capitals , that is to say , with mathematical lines , since capital letters are wholly made up of straight lines and curves , in which it is impossible to detect any trick of the hand , as in what is called running-hand .

So the _ panier a salade _ , improved by the genius of the Paris police , became the model for the prison omnibus -LRB- known in London as `` Black Maria '' -RRB- in which convicts are transported to the hulks , instead of the horrible tumbril which formerly disgraced civilization , though Manon Lescaut had made it famous .

It is , therefore , needful to mention how Paris was , for the moment , excited by the news of the arrest of a Spanish priest , discovered in a courtesan 's house , and that of the elegant Lucien de Rubempre , who had been engaged to Mademoiselle Clotilde de Grandlieu , taken on the highroad to Italy , close to the little village of Grez .

In every drawing-room in Paris more than one young man could recollect having envied Lucien when he was honored by the notice of the beautiful Duchesse de Maufrigneuse ; and every woman knew that he was the favored attache of Madame de Serizy , the wife of one of the Government bigwigs .

The examining judge in whose hands the case was put regarded it as a chance for promotion ; and , to proceed with the utmost rapidity , he had given orders that both the accused should be transferred from La Force to the Conciergerie as soon as Lucien de Rubempre could be brought from Fontainebleau .

As the Abbe Carlos had spent but twelve hours in La Force , and Lucien only half a night , it is useless to describe that prison , which has since been entirely remodeled ; and as to the details of their consignment , it would be only a repetition of the same story at the Conciergerie .

So long as the warrant for committal remains unsigned , the supposed criminal is regarded as merely under suspicion , inculpe of the crime or felony ; when the warrant has been issued , he becomes `` the accused '' -LRB- prevenu -RRB- , and is regarded as such so long as the inquiry is proceeding ; when the inquiry is closed , and as soon as the Court has decided that the accused is to be committed for trial , he becomes `` the prisoner at the bar '' -LRB- accuse -RRB- as soon as the superior court , at the instance of the public prosecutor , has pronounced that the charge is so far proved as to be carried to the Assizes .
